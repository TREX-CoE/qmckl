# QMCkl Release Notes

## Version 1.1.0 - January 2026

### New Features

#### Forces Module
- **NEW**: Added comprehensive forces module (`qmckl_forces.org`)
  - Computing forces on nuclei (interatomic forces) for geometry optimization
  - Support for molecular dynamics simulations
  - Derivatives of wavefunction with respect to nuclear positions
  - Derivatives of Jastrow factor and molecular orbitals (MO)
  - Support for nonlocal pseudopotentials force calculations

#### Single-Precision Jastrow
- **NEW**: Added single-electron move Jastrow module (`qmckl_jastrow_champ_single.org`)
  - Efficient single-electron move calculations
  - Computes differences between old and new Jastrow values
  - Optimized for Quantum Monte Carlo single-electron updates
  - Includes values, gradients, and derivatives

### Compiler Support

#### Intel Compiler Updates
- Added support for Intel's next-generation ifx Fortran compiler
- Added support for Intel's next-generation icx C compiler
- Updated compiler flags for better compatibility:
  - Changed from `-Ofast` to `-O3` for more reliable optimizations
