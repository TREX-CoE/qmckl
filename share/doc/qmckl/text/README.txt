The ultimate goal of the QMCkl library is to provide a high-performance
implementation of the main kernels of Quantum Monte Carlo methods.  In
this particular implementation of the library, we focus on the
definition of the API and the tests, and on a /pedagogical/ presentation
of the algorithms.  We expect the HPC experts to use this repository as
a reference for re-writing optimized libraries.

The source code of the library is available at
<https://github.com/trex-coe/qmckl> and bug reports should be submitted
at <https://github.com/trex-coe/qmckl/issues>.
